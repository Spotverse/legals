    <h1>FAQs</h1>
<h2>How Spotverse Works</h2>
<h3>What are the steps to use Spotverse?</h3>
<p>Here's how Spotverse works:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Select the Location: Express your interest by tapping on places on the map or selecting based on categories such as All, Non-Alcoholic, Alcoholic, LGBTQ+, Live Music, etc.</li>
    <li>Explore the Place: Like or dislike profiles, and apply various filters for search customization, including a particular area, drink type, age, gender, school, etc.</li>
    <li>Match, Chat, and Meet: When two users express mutual interest in the same location and swipe right on each other's profiles, a match occurs. Start chatting and plan a meeting at that location.</li>
</ol>
    <h2>Block a Member</h2>
    <p>To block a user, go to their profile, click the three dots, and then select "Block Member." When a member is blocked, both your communications with that individual and their appearance in matches disappear. Additionally, the person you blocked won't be able to see you anymore.</p>

    <h2>Unblock a Member</h2>
    <p>Blocking a user has an eternal effect. You cannot unblock a member after blocking them.</p>

    <h2>Report a Concern</h2>
    <p>By going to a user's profile, tapping the three dots, and choosing "Report a Problem," you can submit an issue. Choose the response that most accurately expresses your concern and submit. We prioritize the security of our community. Please let us know about rude behavior, offensive photographs, and con artists. All reports are anonymous, and the subject of your complaint will never learn who you are.</p>

    <h2>Photos and Profiles</h2>
