<h1>Cookie Policy</h1>


<h2>What are cookies?</h2>
<div class="text">
    Small text files known as cookies are transferred to or read by your web browser or the memory of your device. A cookie often includes the domain name (Internet address) from which it came, its "lifetime" (the period of time after which it expires), and a randomly generated unique number or other identification. A cookie might also store data about your device, including user preferences, browsing histories, and actions taken while utilizing our services.</div>
<h2>Are there different types of cookies?</h2>
<div class="text" >First-party and third-party cookies</div>
<div class="text">
    There are cookies from both first- and third-parties. We appoint first-party cookies straight to your device. For instance, we use first-party cookies to customize our App to the preferred language of your browser and to learn more about how you use our App. Our partners and service providers may put third-party cookies on your computer or device. By using the consent management tools on our App and in-app, you can find out more about these partners and service providers. See "How can you control cookies?" below for more information on these tools.</div>
<div class="text" >Session and persistent cookies</div>

Session cookies are used for a variety of purposes, including to gather information about how you use our App during a single browser session and to make our App easier for you to use. Longer-lasting and remaining after the current session are persistent cookies. You can use these types of cookies to rapidly log in to our App once again, for analytics, and for other reasons that are detailed below.</div>
<h2>What about other tracking technologies, such as web beacons and SDKs?</h2>
<div class="text">
    Cookies are used for similar objectives as other technologies like web beacons (also known as pixels, tags, or clear gifs), tracking URLs, or software development kits (SDKs). With the use of web beacons, which are tiny graphical files with a unique identifier, we can tell when someone has visited our App or clicked on an email we have sent them. Custom-made connections called tracking URLs allow us to track the sources of visitors to our Apps. Small pieces of code called SDKs are integrated into programs and perform similar tasks to cookies and web beacons.

    In this Cookie Policy, we also refer to these technologies as "cookies" for simplicity's sake.
